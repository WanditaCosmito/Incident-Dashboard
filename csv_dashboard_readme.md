## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Charts**: Recharts for interactive data visualization
- **File Handling**: React-dropzone for CSV uploads
- **Data Processing**: Papa Parse for CSV parsing

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **File Upload**: User uploads CSV file
2. **Parsing**: CSV content parsed and validated
3. **Data Extraction**: Key fields identified and extracted
4. **Text Mining**: DCIM tile information extracted from descriptions using pattern matching
5. **Data Transformation**: Raw data converted to visualization-ready format
6. **Visualization**: Charts and filters dynamically generated

### Key Components
- `CSVUploader`: Handles file upload and initial processing
- `DataProcessor`: Extracts and transforms incident data
- `ChartManager`: Manages all visualization components
- `FilterPanel`: Handles dynamic filtering and search
- `DrillDownView`: Manages hierarchical data exploration

## Data Requirements

### Expected CSV Columns
The system expects CSV files with the following columns (flexible naming):
- **Incident ID/Number**: Unique identifier for each incident
- **Service Tag**: Equipment or service identifier
- **Building/Location**: Physical location information
- **Description**: Detailed incident description (used for DCIM tile extraction)
- **Resolution**: How the incident was resolved
- **Date/Timestamp**: When the incident occurred
- **Status**: Current incident status

### DCIM Tile Extraction
Since DCIM tile information isn't in dedicated columns, the system uses intelligent text parsing to extract this data from incident descriptions. It looks for patterns such as:
- "Tile [number/identifier]"
- "Row [X] Tile [Y]"
- "DCIM-[identifier]"
- Custom patterns based on your data format

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Development Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd csv-incident-dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
REACT_APP_MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB max file size
REACT_APP_SUPPORTED_FORMATS=.csv,.xlsx
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_CHART_THEME=light
```

## Usage Guide

### Uploading Data
1. Navigate to the dashboard homepage
2. Drag and drop your CSV file or click to browse
3. Wait for the file to process (progress indicator shown)
4. Verify that the data was parsed correctly in the preview

### Exploring Data
1. **Monthly Trends**: View incident patterns over time
2. **Building Analysis**: See which buildings have the most incidents
3. **Drill-down**: Click on any building bar to see DCIM tiles within
4. **Filtering**: Use the filter panel to narrow down results
5. **Export**: Download filtered datasets or chart images

### Advanced Features
- **Custom Date Ranges**: Select specific time periods for analysis
- **Multi-building Comparison**: Compare incident rates across buildings
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify seasonal patterns or anomalies
- **Resolution Tracking**: Monitor how quickly incidents are resolved

## Data Processing Logic

### Text Mining for DCIM Tiles
The system uses regular expressions and natural language processing to identify DCIM tile references:

```javascript
// Example patterns used for extraction
const tilePatterns = [
  /tile[\s-]?(\w+)/gi,
  /row[\s-]?(\w+)[\s-]?tile[\s-]?(\w+)/gi,
  /dcim[\s-]?(\w+)/gi,
  // Additional patterns based on your data format
];
```

### Building Location Standardization
Location names are normalized to ensure consistent grouping:
- Removes extra whitespace
- Standardizes abbreviations
- Groups similar location names
- Handles common typos and variations

## API Reference

### Data Processing Endpoints
- `POST /api/upload`: Upload and process CSV file
- `GET /api/data`: Retrieve processed incident data
- `GET /api/buildings`: Get list of all buildings
- `GET /api/tiles/:building`: Get DCIM tiles for specific building

### Filter Parameters
- `dateRange`: Start and end dates
- `buildings`: Array of building names
- `serviceTags`: Array of service tag filters
- `status`: Incident status filter

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Features
- **Lazy Loading**: Charts load as needed
- **Data Pagination**: Large datasets split into manageable chunks
- **Caching**: Processed data cached for faster subsequent loads
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript

### File Size Limits
- Maximum CSV file size: 10MB
- Maximum number of rows: 100,000
- Automatic data sampling for very large files

## Customization

### Adding New Chart Types
1. Create new chart component in `src/components/charts/`
2. Add chart configuration to `chartConfig.js`
3. Register component in `ChartManager.tsx`

### Custom Data Extraction Patterns
Modify `src/utils/dataExtractor.js` to add new patterns for DCIM tile extraction:

```javascript
const customPatterns = [
  // Add your specific patterns here
  /your-custom-pattern/gi
];
```

### Styling Customization
- Modify `tailwind.config.js` for theme changes
- Override CSS classes in `src/styles/custom.css`
- Update chart color schemes in `src/config/chartThemes.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Upload Fails**: Check file size and format
2. **No Data Extracted**: Verify CSV column headers match expected format
3. **DCIM Tiles Not Found**: Check incident descriptions contain tile references
4. **Charts Not Loading**: Clear browser cache and refresh

### Data Quality Issues
- **Missing Dates**: System will flag and skip invalid date entries
- **Duplicate Incidents**: Automatic deduplication based on incident ID
- **Inconsistent Building Names**: Manual review recommended for location standardization

## Contributing

### Development Guidelines
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write unit tests for new features
- Update documentation for any API changes

### Testing
```bash
# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```
